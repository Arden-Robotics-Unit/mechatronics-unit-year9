This is where you can commit your code!

Make sure that your project in the Microbit Python editor has a unique name for each task. A good way to do this is to use your team name followed by the exercise or challenge name - for example 'Team Awesome House Colours'. Now when you save your Python code from the editor, it will automatically call it 'Team Awesome House Colours-main.py'.
